# Eagle layout for alpha

Instead of rotating through layers using our extra R2 key like the default layout,
this layout takes an aproach closer to the vderm layout.
It is also heavily inspired by the Planck line of boards
(which have become the _de facto_ standard for ortho boards,
and so are familiar to most users.)

## Layers

There is some slight mnemonic thought put into the layers.
The *NUMBER* layer is on the side of the keyboard with the `N` key.
The *SYMBOL* layer is on the sidfe with the `S` key,
and as a benefit, most symbols are on the right side of the board,
where they are "expected" to be,
easily accessible without hand contortions.]

The two macros are included because they would be virtually impossible to use without contoprting one's hands.
The `ctrl-alt-del` macro is on the `D` key, for `Delete`,
and the `ctrl-shift-escape` macro is on the `A` key,
mimicing where one's hands would normally be placed to use it.

The `RESET` key is included because the author is incredibly tired of manually shorting pins.
Though it loses out to the function keys as described below,
it is placed beneath the `R` key (and by happy chance, the `F4` key),
either of which should help useres remeber where it is located.

## Concessions

Owing primarily to the small size of the board,
some concessions in key placemnt had to be made.

The main impediment to usability is that there are no numperpad keys.
For most this will be a minor issue,
but some applications will only accept those specific keycodes.
The author suggests a dedicated numberpad in these cases.

The function keys are also not exactly in a row.
In the author's experience, 
most users key track of the function keys as being
such-and-so a distance from the top left or top right corner.
This relationship is maintained.
